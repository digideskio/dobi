# Example - Initialize an application database

A common problem when using rails (and many other web frameworks) with Compose is
initializing the database. The database tables and fixture data is stored as
"models" in the application code.

This example shows how `dobi` can be used to create a database image for a rails
application, and how to use the image with Compose.

To run the example:

    dobi dev


This will create the app and database images, and start a Docker Compose dev
environment using the images.
